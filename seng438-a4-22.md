# Introduction

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

After careful analysis of the mutation score and test coverage, the DataUtilitiesTest class was effective at catching defects. Before performing mutation tests and using our test suite from assignment #3, we have 60% mutation coverage. After performing extensive mutation testing on the test suite, we were able to achieve <b>99%</b>. One thing to keep in mind is that we did not test every method since we worked on improving the methods from the previous assignment.

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

For the DataUtilities test suite, we already had a 60% mutation score so our tests covered a large amount of mutants. However, one thing we noticed is that we didn’t check for null values and mutants for exceptions being thrown. For example, a lot of methods have a function that checks if a parameter is null. When that function was removed, the mutant survived since we did not check exceptions for null values. After checking for exceptions, it increased our mutation score by almost ~8%.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

Mutation testing is a crucial part of the test-case-design and test-evaluation process. By purposely injecting faults into the system. Some advantages of mutation testing is that it measures the quality of test cases, compared with other methods of testing, mutation testing provides the tester with a clear target which is the number of mutants to kill and since there is a greater focus on inspecting the source code, it forces the programmer to think of test data that will expose certain kinds of faults. Some disadvantages associated with mutation testing is that there could be a large amount of equivalent mutants that are undetected by the system, too many mutants could also require a lot of time. The classes we were analyzing weren’t that large and it still took a considerable amount of time. With a much larger system, trying to cover every mutant could be demanding in both time and resources.

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

One clear advantage Selenium has over Sikulix is its ease of use. Since Selenium is available on a variety of browsers, it makes the IDE accessible regardless of the operating system you are using. Along with that, the user interface is friendly and easy to walk through web apps as well as verifying the state of the app. However, a disadvantage that Selenium has is that it is limited to web apps. This is where Sikulix shines because it is able to work on both web apps as well as window applications. Although versatile, a disadvantage of Sikulix is that it analyzes screenshots so because of that, it might select the wrong screenshot. Along with that, it can be overwhelming managing a large amount of screenshots, especially if an application has many screens.
